2x^2 - 5x - 3 = 0 -1,1.5
The coefficents are odd see if you can use completing the square or quadratic formula
Remember a, b and c terms for the quadratic formula and that you need to add b^2 / 4 to both sides to complete the square
3x^2 + 6x - 9 = 0 -3,1
this whole equation can be divided by a single number
you can divide this equation by a single number and that you can factor by using 3 and -3 for the two binomials
x^2 -4x + 4 = 0 2
There is only one solution
-2 and -2 add to -4 and multiply to 4 making it the number to use when factoring
4x^2 - 12x = 0 0,3
Take the x out
Divide the whole left side by x then solve for x both outside and inside the parentheses
